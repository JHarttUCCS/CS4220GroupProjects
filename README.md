### Program Description
This program was developed to help us better understand how to apply security concepts in networking, especially with protocols like TLS and SSL. This can help us learn more about how we can protect information that is sent over a network. The information between a web server and client must be both encrypted and authenticated to help protect user information, and creating this network allows us to see how this is done. We can see potential risks for security, especially since private information is often sent over the internet, so it is important to ensure that we are keeping that data safe when it is transmitted. The scenario we are working with in this project is the idea of having a web browser (client) accessing a website (server) that they must share private information with, such as a credit card number, so we must allow for a secure transmission. We want this information to be secure and not be able to be read by a malicious actor, so we must implement secure practices to protect the information.

### How to Run the Program

### Pieces of the Assignment (with a brief description)

### Challenges (Problems encountered and how they were solved and what you learned)
1. When designing the TLS client, we originally miswrote which buffer we were writing to, and got the buffers confused.  This was another way of learning how context-sensitive everything around our operations is.
2. When building the Makefile, we noticed that we could not build the OpenSSL code with a default set up.   In the end, we had to add custom SSL flags to the compiler to get it to compile SSL code, just like you would with something like _GNU_SOURCE.

### Notes (about resources used)
[This project](https://github.com/darrenjs/openssl_examples) inspired much of the TLS code in the project.
