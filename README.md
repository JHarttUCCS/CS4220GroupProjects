### Program Description
This program was developed to help us better understand how to apply security concepts in networking, especially with protocols like TLS and SSL. This can help us learn more about how we can protect information that is sent over a network. The information between a web server and client must be both encrypted and authenticated to help protect user information, and creating this network allows us to see how this is done. We can see potential risks for security, especially since private information is often sent over the internet, so it is important to ensure that we are keeping that data safe when it is transmitted. The scenario we are working with in this project is the idea of having a web browser (client) accessing a website (server) that they must share private information with, such as a credit card number, so we must allow for a secure transmission. We want this information to be secure and not be able to be read by a malicious actor, so we must implement secure practices to protect the information.
